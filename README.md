# graphical_modeling

  * This repo contains examples of graphical models with explanations in notebooks in the notebooks directory. The presentation.pptx is a useful intro to the models used.
  * The probablistic_modeling.ipynb contains presentation notes and it is not meant to be part of the examples. Refer to the notebooks directory for examples after going through the presentation.pptx and then the probablistic_modeling.ipynb notebook.
# Files
  * notebooks/* contains examples in pystan which should be self explanatory.
  * img/* contains images used in the notebooks.
  * data/* contains some csv files used in the notebooks.
  * presentation.pptx presentation based on the main notebook probablistic_modeling.ipynb.
  * probablistic_modeling.ipynb main notebook containing the knowledge to be presented.
# Exmples
