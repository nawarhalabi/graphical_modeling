    "* Comparing Generative and Discriminative models.\n",
    "* Where does belief propagation and MCMC fit in Graphical modelling as concepts.\n",
    "* In the case of HMM why do we use belief propagation when inferring hidden states with statsics params. But we use EM when trying to infer the parameters given some data.\n",
    "* Is the difference between frequentist and baysian approaches only with the fact that we add priors in baysian stuff? Yes, but the choice of priors is a field of study. But it is a weaker assumption to be baysian.\n",
    "* When is the EM algorithm applicable? Dunno\n",
    "* Does Gibbs sampling work on all architectures and compare to NUTS? No\n",
    "* STAN can we use it? Would we lose any benefit? No.\n",
    "* Which lib has better future? Dunno, stan does not smaple from descrete vars must integrate out.\n",
    "* What about nonparametric mixtures? Did not do."
